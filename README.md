## `base-html.kit`
This file contains many standard HTML elements and allows you to see how they display as you style your site. This file should be deleted before launching your finished site. It's adapted from Jukka Korpela's [Test display of HTML elements](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www/testel.html).

## `mixins.scss`
Mixins for golden ratios, fonts, properties that use rems but fall back to pixels, plus cross browser support for various properties.

## `modernizr.js`
A development version of [modernizr](http://modernizr.com) (v2.7.0).
